## Engineering Philosophy

Engineering should be structured, collaborative, and intentional.

- Order over chaos  
- Quality over shortcuts  
- Simplicity over unnecessary complexity  
- Process that enables teams  
- Long-term thinking  
- Shared ownership and accountability  

Great systems are built by disciplined teams.
